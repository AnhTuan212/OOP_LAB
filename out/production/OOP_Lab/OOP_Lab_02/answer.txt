Q1:If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes, Java allows you to do this .Constructor overloading in Java means having multiple constructors in the same class, but with different parameter lists.Java will automatically choose the correct constructor to call based on the arguments you provide when creating the object.

Q2:Why does the swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) not change the titles of the DVDs?
Java is strictly pass-by-value. When you pass an object to a method, Java passes a copy of the reference (not the actual object and not the actual reference).

Q3:Why does changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) change the title of jungleDVD?
dvd.setTitle(title) modifies the actual DVD object that jungleDVD points to. This is because the reference copy still points to the same object.
dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc(oldTitle) creates a new object and makes the local dvd variable point to it â€” but this change does not affect the original jungleDVD reference in main()
